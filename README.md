## Line Commander

First download and unzip the games folders, if you are on Mac/Linux then it's[GAME.zip](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/bootcamp-homework/raw/master/assets/GAME.zip), if you are using a windows machine then download [GAME_WINDOWS.zip](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/bootcamp-homework/raw/master/assets/GAME_WINDOWS.zip).

Once you extract the contents you will see that it contains a folder called GAME or GAME_WINDOWS. Move that folder (not the .zip file) to a place on your computer where you would like to store it.

## Getting to the folder on the command line.

- If you are on a mac, right click on the folder and select `New Terminal at Folder` or `Services > New Terminal at Folder` or equivalent.
- If you are on windows then you will first need to download [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) ([tutorial here if you need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbFwejIsHlY)) in order to start playing. Once you have Git Bash installed, right click on the GAME folder and select `Git Bash Here`. This will start a Git Bash terminal at the correct location so that we can start the game.

## Playing the game

To read your first instruction you must use our first ever bash command! `cat`, followed by a file name, prints the text contents of the file to the screen. The file we want to read is called `start.txt`, so we can type in `cat start.txt`.

Give it a go and with any luck you will have your next instruction.

## Make a Website

To help cement all the skills you’ve learn so far, we’d like you to make your first webpage using html and css, initialise a Git repo, and push it up to GitHub!

Website should include…

- Picture of you
- Brief Bio
- Intro to who you are/what you enjoy doing/interests, etc

Try using some HTML tags and CSS Properties you haven’t seen yet!
